## Project Guidelines

1. Join the Teams group `TS Mobile Innovation Group`
2. Following homework assignments in the Wiki and in the Files section of Teams

Each project `iOS` and `Android` should 'just run' out of the box by following the `readme` in each folder.

If you have issues installing and running either code repos, please contact Timothy Dillman for help.

# Images and Classification

We will be using the IRS's definition of a W2

Specifically form Form-W2 revision 2017 [here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/fw2--2017.pdf)

Our aim is to have models that can classify each W2 form type that are supported by the IRS found [here](https://apps.irs.gov/app/picklist/list/priorFormPublication.html?sortColumn=currentYearRevDate&indexOfFirstRow=0&value=W-2&criteria=formNumber&resultsPerPage=25&isDescending=true)

We can try for the W2 gambling form is things go well.
